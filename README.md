# Addons
Addons for Final Fantasy XI via Windower4

## Drop:

Oiriginal Author: Arico

Drop items with commands

//drop <item>     --Drops the item.

Some custom lists I added

//drop list cells     --Drops all Salvage cells.  
//drop lisy rems      --Drops all Rems Ch. 6-10.



## Greylist:

Heavily based on the addon Fuckoff by Chiaia

Some people are very nice, but I want to avoid for certain content.
Whenever someone on your greylist sends a tell it just says "<name> is on your greylist."

//gl      -- lists all the names.

//gl add <name>     -- add a name.  
//gl a <name>     -- add a name.

//gl remove <name>      -- remove a name.  
//gl r <name>     -- remove a name.

//gl save     -- saves the current character's local list to global for all characters.  
//gl s      -- saves the current character's local list to global for all characters.

//gl find <name>      -- Searches list for a name. Tells you if they are on your greylist or not.  
//gl f <name>     -- Searches list for a name. Tells you if they are on your greylist or not.



## AtTheTone:

Just gives you the time with commands.
I made this primarly for use with React for abilities like Yaegasumi.

//att rt    --Gives you the real world time and day.

//att gt    --Give you the Vanadiel time and day.

//att     --Gives you both. Does not give you the day.
